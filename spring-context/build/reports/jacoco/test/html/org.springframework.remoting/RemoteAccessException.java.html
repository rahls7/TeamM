/**
 * Generic remote access exception. A service proxy for any remoting
 * protocol should throw this exception or subclasses of it, in order
 * to transparently expose a plain Java business interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When using conforming proxies, switching the actual remoting protocol
 * e.g. from Hessian does not affect client code. Clients work with a plain
 * natural Java business interface that the service exposes. A client object
 * simply receives an implementation for the interface that it needs via a
 * bean reference, like it does for a local bean as well.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A client may catch RemoteAccessException if it wants to, but as
 * remote access errors are typically unrecoverable, it will probably let
 * such exceptions propagate to a higher level that handles them generically.
 * In this case, the client code doesn't show any signs of being involved in
 * remote access, as there aren't any remoting-specific dependencies.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Even when switching from a remote service proxy to a local implementation
 * of the same interface, this amounts to just a matter of configuration. Obviously,
 * the client code should be somewhat aware that it &lt;i&gt;might be working&lt;/i&gt;
 * against a remote service, for example in terms of repeated method calls that
 * cause unnecessary roundtrips etc. However, it doesn't have to be aware whether
 * it is &lt;i&gt;actually working&lt;/i&gt; against a remote service or a local implementation,
 * or with which remoting protocol it is working under the hood.
