/** The kinds of solutions that a {@link BracketedUnivariateSolver
 * (bracketed univariate real) root-finding algorithm} may accept as solutions.
 * This basically controls whether or not under-approximations and
 * over-approximations are allowed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;If all solutions are accepted ({@link #ANY_SIDE}), then the solution
 * that the root-finding algorithm returns for a given root may be equal to the
 * actual root, but it may also be an approximation that is slightly smaller
 * or slightly larger than the actual root. Root-finding algorithms generally
 * only guarantee that the returned solution is within the requested
 * tolerances. In certain cases however, in particular for
 * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.ode.events.EventHandler state events} of
 * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.ode.ODEIntegrator ODE solvers}, it
 * may be necessary to guarantee that a solution is returned that lies on a
 * specific side the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
