/**
 * Task scheduler interface that abstracts the scheduling of
 * {@link Runnable Runnables} based on different kinds of triggers.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is separate from {@link SchedulingTaskExecutor} since it
 * usually represents for a different kind of backend, i.e. a thread pool with
 * different characteristics and capabilities. Implementations may implement
 * both interfaces if they can handle both kinds of execution characteristics.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The 'default' implementation is
 * {@link org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler},
 * wrapping a native {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService}
 * and adding extended trigger capabilities.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This interface is roughly equivalent to a JSR-236
 * {@code ManagedScheduledExecutorService} as supported in Java EE 7
 * environments but aligned with Spring's {@code TaskExecutor} model.
