	 * Does this {@code TaskExecutor} prefer short-lived tasks over long-lived tasks?

	 * prefers submitted tasks to perform as little work as they can within a single
	 * task execution. For example, submitted tasks might break a repeated loop into
	 * individual subtasks which submit a follow-up task afterwards (if feasible).
	 * &lt;p&gt;This should be considered a hint. Of course {@code TaskExecutor} clients
	 * are free to ignore this flag and hence the {@code SchedulingTaskExecutor}
	 * interface overall. However, thread pools will usually indicated a preference
	 * for short-lived tasks, allowing for more fine-grained scheduling.
	 * @return {@code true} if this executor prefers short-lived tasks (the default),
	 * {@code false} otherwise (for treatment like a regular {@code TaskExecutor})
